## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```plaintext
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ braindb.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ”— Features

### Backlinks

This digital garden includes automatic backlinks powered by BrainDB. When you link to other pages using wiki-style syntax `[[Page Name]]`, the linked page will automatically show a "Backlinks" section in its table of contents, displaying all pages that link to it.

**How it works:**

- Use `[[Page Name]]` syntax to create links between pages
- Backlinks automatically appear in the table of contents sidebar
- Only shows links from published pages (drafts are hidden in production)

**To disable backlinks on a specific page:**

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
backlinks: false
---
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
