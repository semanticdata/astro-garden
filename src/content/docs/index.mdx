## How This Garden Grows

These are the principles that guide this space. Think of them as the gardener's notes on the shed wall.

  <Card title="Living Notes" icon="pencil">
    Unlike a blog post, notes here are never "finished." They are living documents that I prune, graft, and tend to over time as my understanding deepens.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Connected Thoughts" icon="seti:pipeline">
		Ideas rarely stand alone. Notes are woven together through a network of links. Follow your curiosity and discover unexpected connections.
	</Card>
	<Card title="All Stages of Growth" icon="seti:favicon">
		You'll find everything from rough **seedlings** to well-developed **evergreens**. This garden values the entire process, not just the final harvest.
