Hello, I'm Miguel Pimentelâ€”a self-taught developer from the Dominican Republic, now living in Minnesota. I suffer from a chronic case of curiosity, which has led me to explore diverse fields: designing bike trails in AutoCAD, getting licensed as a firefighter, creating browser extensions, and learning emergency medicine.

This is my [[digital-garden|digital garden]], where I cultivate thoughts, collect interesting discoveries, and document my ongoing learning journey. Unlike traditional blogs, these notes grow and evolve over time through [[continuous-care|continuous care]], connected by ideas rather than chronology.

## What You'll Find Here

My garden contains [[atomic-notes|atomic notes]]â€”focused, self-contained thoughts that can stand alone or connect to form larger ideas. I'm currently implementing a growth system (ðŸŒ± seedlings, ðŸŒ¿ budding, ðŸŒ³ evergreen) to indicate the maturity of different notes as they develop.

The **[[free-facts|Free Facts]]** collection showcases my favorite type of discoveryâ€”those wonderfully random pieces of knowledge that serve no practical purpose but satisfy an itch of curiosity. I also maintain a growing collection of **[[words|Words I Like]]** because language fascinates me, and a **[[uses|Uses]]** page documenting the tools that power my daily workflows.

## Knowledge Systems

My approach to managing information centers around [[sweep-your-mind|sweeping your mind]]â€”getting thoughts out of your head and into a reliable system. This garden serves as both my external brain and a testament to [[consistency|consistency]] over intensity in learning.

The development side of my curiosity surfaces in notes about [[git|Git]] for version control, [[cli-commands-cheat-sheet|CLI commands]], [[neovim|NeoVim]] for text editing, tutorials on everything from [[first-love-game|creating your first LÃ–VE game]] to [[publish-logseq-graph-github|publishing Logseq graphs on GitHub]], and explorations of tools like [[espanso-cheat-sheet|Espanso]] for text expansion.

## Professional Work

I currently work as the Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal, Minnesota, overseeing public infrastructure projects from conception through completion, along with traffic studies and ROW permits. With over 10 years in public construction, I've developed a systems-thinking approach that carries over into how I organize knowledge and approach problemsâ€”whether technical or otherwise.

**New to digital gardens?** Start with [[words|Words I Like]] if you enjoy language and definitions, explore [[uses|Uses]] if you're curious about tools and workflows, or dive into [[encouragements|Encouragements]] if you want to see how I approach motivation and habits. Each note connects to others, so follow your curiosity wherever it leads.
