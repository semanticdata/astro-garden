:::note[Summary]
Forgetful Notes is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation theme. The content is managed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and parsed by [BrainDB](https://github.com/semantic-data/braindb) during the build process. The site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can explore the [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/astro-garden).

## Background

Forgetful Notes has gone through many changes. I have not been shy about moving from technology to technology as I learn new things. Coming across the world of [[Static Site Generators|Static Site Generators]] was a game changer. I have ran my notes through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and even [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

The journey continues. This latest iteration embraces the modern web with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a framework known for its incredible performance and "islands architecture." For the look, feel, and features, I'm using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), a dedicated documentation and knowledge base theme for Astro. This combination provides both a fantastic developer experience and a fast, accessible site for readers.

## Technology

The core philosophy remains the same: write in plain text and use powerful tools to build the site.

- **Content:** All notes are written in [[Markdown|Markdown]] within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This provides a powerful local-first writing environment with excellent linking and organization capabilities.

- **The "Brain":** The magic that connects my Obsidian vault to the website is [BrainDB](https://github.com/semantic-data/braindb). During the build process, BrainDB reads my entire vault, parsing [[wikilinks]], backlinks, tags, and metadata. It creates a structured data graph that the site generator can understand.

- **The Engine:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) is the static site generator that builds the final website. It takes the Markdown content and data from BrainDB and renders it into highly optimized HTML and CSS. The [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme provides the site's structure, navigation, search, and overall design system.

## Features

This new stack provides a fantastic set of features, many of them out-of-the-box with Starlight and Astro.

- **Fast, Full-Text Search** (powered by Pagefind)
- **Bidirectional Backlinks** (thanks to BrainDB)
- **Dark & Light Mode**
- **Admonition-style Callouts**
- **Markdown & Wikilink Support**
- **Support for UI Components** (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) within Markdown
- **Table of Contents** on every page
- **Latex Support** for mathematical notation

## Project Structure

The project is now a standard Astro project, with a directory for the Obsidian notes that BrainDB processes.
